# unraid-vm-xml-gpu-fixer

## Background

Periodically I've run into the issue where I need to make a modification to my Unraid VM config.
I make the change in the form view, but it overwrites my changes in the XML to fix the GPU passthrough.

While the Unraid team so-far hasn't implemented a proper workaround for GPU passthrough in windows machines, I decided to write this script to save me some time.
